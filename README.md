# LWC Projects

Here are just a few Lightning Web Components I've made in my time as a Solution Architect. They are rough proofs of concept, meant to be passed to a developer for refactoring, scalability, etc. If you're learning LWC as I am, you might be interested in these too. The full list of LWCs here are:

* Custom Case Note Viewer: LWC that allows users to filter Case Notes by Contact and export them
* Experience Cloud Path: An LWC that takes the ContactId of an Experience Cloud user, accesses a picklist and displays it in the form of a Path for use in Experience Clouds
* Printable View NPC: LWC that duplicates the "Printable View" functionality, not currently available on Nonprofit Cloud (NPC) objects
